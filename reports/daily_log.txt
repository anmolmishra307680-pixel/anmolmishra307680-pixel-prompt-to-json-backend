PROMPT-TO-JSON AGENT - DAILY LOG
================================

Day 1 - January 10, 2025
------------------------
Goal: Repo merge + base pipeline (setup & integration)

COMPLETED:
✅ Created unified folder structure (spec_outputs, evaluations, rl_logs, reports, docs)
✅ Built src/main.py - CLI entrypoint with --prompt and --prompt-file support
✅ Integrated existing extractor.py with main pipeline
✅ Added sample specifications (sample_spec_01.json, sample_spec_02.json)
✅ Connected evaluator_agent.py to main pipeline
✅ Implemented slug generation and timestamping
✅ Added comprehensive error handling and summary output

PIPELINE FLOW:
1. Extract fields from prompt → extractor.extract_basic_fields()
2. Apply smart fallbacks → utils.apply_fallbacks()
3. Save spec to spec_outputs/<slug>_<timestamp>.json
4. Evaluate spec → evaluator_agent.evaluate_spec()
5. Save evaluation to evaluations/
6. Print summary to stdout

HONESTY: The existing codebase was already quite comprehensive, so Day 1 focused on creating the unified CLI interface and ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

DISCIPLINE: Followed the exact requirements - created minimal but functional main.py that wires all components together with proper CLI interface.

GRATITUDE: Thankful for the solid foundation already built in Tasks 1 & 2. The extractor, evaluator, and utilities were well-designed and easy to integrate.

NEXT: Day 2 will focus on LLM integration and advanced pipeline features.

Example usage:
python src/main.py --prompt "Design a 2-floor library using glass and concrete"
python src/main.py --prompt-file prompts/example.txt
